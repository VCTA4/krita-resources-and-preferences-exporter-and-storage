Hello! This small utility serves for convenient storage and quick installation of all KRITA resources.

With its help, you can eliminate repetitive steps from the resource creation process.
And by using it you can also speed up the installation process of your resources to the activation of one .bat file. 
(this feature can make it easier for you to configure the program when transferring program settings to another PC)
For each resource type there is a folder that stores small instructions and .bat files for installing that resource type 
and cleaning up its target folder.
If you want to install all your resources at once, you can use .bat files from the shared folder.
At the resource creation stage, I recommend trying out the backup functions available in this utility.

This utility will work only if the following path is specified in the resource folder setting
```
C:/Users/%USERNAME%/AppData/Roaming/krita
```
If you have not changed this setting in any way after the first launch of KRITA, the utility will also work correctly
